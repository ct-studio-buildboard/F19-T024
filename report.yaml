product_hmw: How might we identify cultural idiosyncrasies to help photographers shoot fresh, local content? 
product_narrative: |
  Shutterstock has an amazing repository of stock images. However with increasing globalization of internet, we are finding it hard to keep up with the demand for fresh
  and local content. We are planing to use the power of Big Data analytics to identify trends and backfill those trends by matching the need with existing contributors who
  might be able to fulfill them.
